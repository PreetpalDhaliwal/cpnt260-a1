  <body>

   <p class="test">Basketball has been in my life ever since my childhood. My family and my cousins grew up watching
  the sport as well as seeing it evolve over the years. Me and my entire family's favourite G.O.A.T. basketball
  player has to be <b><i>Lebron James</i></b> </p>

  <h2>My Top 5 Players</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>LeBron James</li>
    <li>Dwayne Wade</li>
    <li>Kobe Bryant</li>
    <li>Micheal Jordan</li>
    <li>Stephen Curry</li>
  </ol>



  <p>LeBron James continues to inspire me as he plays, he's the most down-to-earth person that I have come across.
    Others might think I am crazy or a fanboy, but in reality, im not. He's just a really generous and caring 
    human being. For example, he opened up a school where he provides fundraising for education. The school
    is called <a href="https://ipromise.school/">'I Promise School.'</a> 
  </p>

  <h3>Fundraisings 
    include:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Free uniforms</li>
    <li>Free tuition</li>
    <li>Free breakfast, snacks and lunch</li>
    <li>GED's and jobs services for parents</li>
    <li>Guaranteed free education to the university of Akron, Ohio to every student who graduates</li>
  </ol>
